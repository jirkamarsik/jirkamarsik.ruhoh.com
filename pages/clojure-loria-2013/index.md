UPDATE 12/04 22.37: OK, it's booked now. The next Clojure seminar will
be on the 21/02 at 15.30 in C003. We will look at how to iterate using
recursion, what are the collection abstractions in Clojure and how to
efficiently manipulate them using the standard higher-order functions,
i.e. how to actually do really useful stuff in an easy way.
