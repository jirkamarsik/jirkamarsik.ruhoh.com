title : About Me
description:
---

I am a student of the
[Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies]
(http://lct-master.org/), currently residing at
[Universit√© de Lorraine] (http://univ-lorraine.fr) in Nancy.

I started this blog so I could have a place to write down my notes on
various academic and practical subjects in a way that is accessible to
others. I hope to clarify my own thoughts by committing them to
digital paper and to contribute some little value to the vast body of
text that is the Internet. I would be thrilled if some of what I wrote
also turned out to be useful or enlightening to someone.
