During a training seminar on teaching methods, I had the opportunity to work
on, prepare and then give a short three-minute presentation of my PhD research
that is relatable and engaging enough for a broad audience (essentially the
same format as the
[Ma th√®se en 180 secondes](http://www.univ-lorraine.fr/180secondes)
competition).

Here is a subtitled recording of my last rendition of my presentation. The
credit for the idea of decomposing the link between WORLD and LANGUAGE into
WORLD -- MODEL -- LOGIC -- LANGUAGE goes to the great Patrick Blackburn.
